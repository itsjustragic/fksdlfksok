            <div class="about-box">
                <p><strong>Life and Legacy:</strong> Born on October 14, 1993, in Arlington Heights, Illinois, Charlie Kirk emerged as a leading voice for conservatism. At just 18, he founded Turning Point USA in 2012, revolutionizing youth engagement in politics and growing it into a national movement with chapters on over 2,500 campuses.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Kirk’s media presence through "The Charlie Kirk Show" podcast and his bestselling books, like *The MAGA Doctrine*, inspired millions. He championed Second Amendment rights, pro-life policies, and traditional values, often clashing with progressive ideologies on college tours.</p>
                <p><strong>Tragic End:</strong> On September 10, 2025, Kirk was fatally shot during a speech at Utah Valley University. His death at age 31 shocked the nation, but his work continues to fuel the conservative movement. Survived by his wife, Erika, and their mission to protect free speech lives on.</p>
                <p><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Join us in honoring Charlie by reporting those who rejoiced in his passing, ensuring his legacy endures.</p>
