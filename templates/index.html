            <h3>ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK</h3>
            <p>Charlie Kirk (October 14, 1993 – September 10, 2025) was an American right-wing political activist, entrepreneur, and media personality. He founded Turning Point USA at age 18, which became a major force in mobilizing young conservatives on college campuses across the United States.</p>
            <p>Kirk's impact was profound: he espoused culturally conservative views, advocating for gun rights, condemning abortion, and promoting traditional gender roles. Through podcasts, campus tours, and social media, he motivated millions of young Republicans, shaping a new generation of conservative activists.</p>
            <p>Tragically, Kirk was killed in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event. His legacy continues to inspire those who value free speech, conservative principles, and youth engagement in politics.</p>
